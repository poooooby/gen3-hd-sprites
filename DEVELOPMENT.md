# Gen 3 HD Sprites: developer guide

For mod authors and contributors. Players only need the [README](README.md).

## How it works

Gen 3 draws a battle into a 240×160 canvas and the field into a world canvas, then scales them up
by a whole number, so a sprite shrunk or moved by part of a pixel is resampled on that grid. This
mod lifts tagged sprites off it.

A "pass" is the drawing of one canvas: the battle (from `Battle.draw` to the frame's end), a
Pokédex screen (from its `Pokedex.draw`; inside a battle the battle pass covers it) or the field
(`Renderer:beginWorldPass` … `endWorldPass`). While a pass runs, a draw of a tagged image is
recorded instead of drawn, and everything drawn after it goes to a fresh transparent layer. When
the Renderer blits that canvas to the window (`Renderer:blitCanvas`), the blit becomes: the
canvas, each recorded sprite at window resolution, the next layer, and so on. The game's draw
order is kept exactly: the battle HUD, text box, menus and fades stay on top; in the field, roofs
and tree tops still cover what walks under them, and the player and NPCs still sort against
tagged Pokémon.

When a frame can't be composited that way it is drawn the usual low-res way, so nothing is ever
lost: a canvas swapped out mid-pass (Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald weather that reads the field), tilt
mode, a battle transition, or more tagged draws in one frame than the cap (8 in battle and the
Pokédex, 12 in the field; `cap(pass)` / `setCap(pass, n)`). Tagged draws with nothing drawn
between them share one layer. A layer is one window-sized canvas, so a high cap costs memory
only in scenes that use it.

## API (`mod.exports`)

```lua
local hd = mod:find("gen3-hd-sprites")
local ex = hd and hd.exports
if ex and ex.isActive() then
  -- an overworld sheet: drawn where it is drawn, 75% of its size, standing on its feet
  ex.tag(sheetImage, { scale = 0.75, anchor = "feet" })
  -- a battle pic: the engine draws the 64x64 `pic`, this draws `frame` of `page` instead
  ex.tag(pic, { texture = page, quad = frame, pivot = { 47, 90 }, lowPivot = { 32, 32 }, scale = 1 })
end
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `scale` | size multiplier, any value (default 1) |
| `anchor = "feet"` | scale about the bottom-centre of the drawn quad |
| `texture`, `quad` | draw this full-resolution frame in place of the tagged image |
| `pivot` | the point of `texture`/`quad` that stands where the tagged image's `lowPivot` was drawn |
| `lowPivot` | default `{32, 32}`, the engine's battle-pic origin |
| `quadPivots` | `{ [quad] = {x, y, scale} }`: a draw through one of these quads scales about its own quad-local point (and, with `scale`, at its own size; `1` = a slice already drawn at its final size). Read at draw time, so it may grow. Check `features.quadPivots` |
| `filter` | `"nearest"` (default) or `"linear"` |

Also `untag(image)`, `isActive()`, `enabled(pass)`, `setEnabled(pass, on)`, `cap(pass)`,
`setCap(pass, n)`, `features` (`{ quadPivots = true }`) and `stats()` (`splits`, `composites`,
`flattened`, `overCap`). Tags are weak: an image that is freed drops its tag. Keep the tagged
image itself a real low-res picture: it is what shows whenever a frame falls back.

## Tests

`luajit tests/hd_test.lua` (a fake `love.graphics`; no game needed). Every test file is listed by
exact path in `.modkitignore`.

Keep [README.md](README.md) describing the mod as it is now (players read it).
